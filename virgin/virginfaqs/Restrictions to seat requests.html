What are the restrictions on selecting my seat?

You can assign seats after booking your flight or any time in the run up to check in opening through Manage your flights, prices start from £25.  Seats can be assigned up to 24 hours before departure.

If there are no seats showing as available to request, your seats will be allocated to you at the airport. However it's worth visiting Manage your flights at regular intervals because people do cancel and seats become available.
Seat assignments for Seat Plus customers are made and confirmed during check in at the airport by an airport agent, which means online seat assignments and online check in are not available.
If you are travelling with infants, you will be unable to request seats online.  You can however call one of our contact centres to request seats. Whether you choose seats before you get to the airport or not, we will always make sure that every child is sat next to at least one parent or adult guardian, children will not be seated alone.  We define a child as being less than 12 years.
If you have booked as part of a ‘Recognised Group’ via our in house Groups department, where there is a group leader and all the passengers are known to each other, please speak to your booking agent who can submit any seating requests to us. Our Groups Sales Team will action any seating requests received.
