What is a booking reference number?
A booking reference is a unique code specific to an individual reservation. It is also known as a Record/Booking Locator (or RecLoc), PNR Code, confirmation number or reference number. It can be found on your tickets, confirmation invoice or travel documentation.

Virgin Atlantic's booking reference is a six digit alphanumeric combination. E-tickets issued by Virgin Atlantic list this as a 'Booking Reference', which can be found on the e-ticket receipt under 'Ticket numbers & Endorsements'. The number starts with 932 and is 13 digits long. Tickets issued by Virgin Atlantic will contain this code in the PNR Code box near the centre of the ticket.

For example, John Robert Smith would be entered as:
