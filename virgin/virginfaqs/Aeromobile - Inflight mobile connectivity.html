Can I access the internet during my flight?
Yes, you can access the internet using your phone and connected tablet.  However, using data when roaming can be expensive, so check with your operator for roaming allowances and charges to avoid any surprises. When you switch your phone on, you will likely receive a SMS from your home operator with pricing information.
