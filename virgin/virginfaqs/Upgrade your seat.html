How do I upgrade my seat?
When booking your flight online, you will be given the option to upgrade your seat at the best price available.

Once you have a ticket, or if you have previously booked your flight, you can upgrade your seat online by logging into the manage your flights section of our website.  You must upgrade your seat up to 3 days before your flight is due to depart.  You will need your e-ticket number/booking reference number to retrieve your booking details.

Please note you will only be able to upgrade your seats online if you have booked directly with Virgin Atlantic.  For all other bookings you will need to contact your travel agent or tour operator if you wish to book an upgrade.

If you are a Flying Club member and wish to use your miles to upgrade, please call the Flying Club helpline.

If you are having any difficulties upgrading your seat, then please contact the reservations team to assist you with your upgrade. 

Please note, upgrades are issued subject to availability.
