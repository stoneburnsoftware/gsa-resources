How do I select my own seats from a seat map?
If a seat map button is displayed on the 'booking confirmation' page or within the Manage your flights section, then clicking this button will launch the seat map for that flight and show you if seats are available to choose.

Your current seat request (if applicable) is displayed in the box next to each passenger name, and shown with a person in the seat on the seat map itself. You can change your seat by clicking on an available seat shown on the map, or by typing an available seat number into the box next to the passenger name. To proceed click 'Continue', where you will be taken to enter your payment details (if applicable) and then a confirmation page.
