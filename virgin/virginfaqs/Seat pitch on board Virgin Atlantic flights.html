How much leg room will I have on board?

If you are flying Economy class, then you will be impressed with our average seat pitch of 31 inches. Our Economy class seats are designed to maximise legroom.

Premium Economy flyers can enjoy an increased seat width of 21 inches, (equivalent to many other airlines' business class).  This increased width makes it around 3 inches wider than many other airlines' Premium Economy seats.   Seat pitch in this cabin is 37 to 38 inches.

The Upper Class Suite has a 22" (56cm) wide seat, making it not only wider than both BA's seats, but wider than many of our key competitors' first class seats.   The length of the flat bed exceeds 6'.
