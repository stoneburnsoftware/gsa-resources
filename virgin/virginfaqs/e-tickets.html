What are e-tickets?
Electronic Tickets (E-Ticket) are held in our reservations system and alleviate the necessity of a paper document being issued. However, for immigration and security purposes, we will issue an E-Ticket Receipt that can be generated via e-mail/fax or manual document (by post).

E-Tickets provide the following customer benefits:

No more lost, misplaced or even stolen tickets.
Faster check in - all passenger details are ready and waiting.
You can change your flight shortly before departure (subject to availability and charges may apply; you must go to the ticket desk at the airport of departure to confirm any changes).
It's a more environmentally conscious way of operating, with far less paper being used up.
Please note - you will not receive your E-Ticket until your payment has been processed.
