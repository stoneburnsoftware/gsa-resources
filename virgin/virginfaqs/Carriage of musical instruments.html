Can I carry musical instruments on board?

Passengers carrying one musical instrument in its case, which is too large to fit within the cabin baggage allowance, may carry it through the airport security checkpoint subject to the relevant Airport Authority approval, where it will be taken at the departure gate for loading into the hold of the aircraft.

This item will incur excess baggage charges if it is in excess of your free baggage allowance.

Please contact us in advance, if you have any questions or if you plan to carry a large musical instrument.
