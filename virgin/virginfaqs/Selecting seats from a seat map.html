Changes to the way you choose your seats in advance

From 18 November 2014 seats will be available at time of booking, from 336 days before travel.  Seats can be assigned through Manage your booking which is available up to 24 hours before departure.  

Economy customers will be able to pay to choose seats up to 336 days in advance. If you’re travelling to or from Tokyo you’ll also be able to choose standard seats 336 days in advance, free of charge.
Exit row and extra legroom seats will be available to choose and buy from the online seat map up to 336 days in advance, on all routes.
If you booked your flight before the 12 November 2014, you can assign a standard seat, free of charge 60 days before your flight departure. If you are selecting seats before March 2015 for travel within 60 days, you will need to speak to our contact centres who will manually waive the fee.
Please note.  If you already have a seat selected for a flight that departs either before or after 18 November 2014 you will be able to keep it.

How much will advanced seat assignment cost?

The cost to assign a seat starts from £25 per person per flight (£50 per round trip) on Virgin Atlantic long haul flights, this is with the exception of our Tokyo route which will remain free of charge.

There will be no charge on Virgin Atlantic Little Red UK domestic flights.

Please note: For now you won’t be able to pay to choose your seat using Miles or Miles plus money, but we hope to be able to offer you this soon.
