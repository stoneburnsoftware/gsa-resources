What do passengers experience in Premium Economy?
Premium Economy was first introduced in 1992 and has been imitated by many other carriers.

Our Premium Economy seat features enhanced ergonomics for increased comfort and is the biggest seat in its class.   It has leather seat covers and increased seat width of 21 inches (equivalent to other airlinesâ€™ business class) - around 3 inches wider than other airlines' Premium Economy seats.

As well as in-seat laptop power, passengers can enjoy priority boarding, a separate cabin, pre-departure drink, and a video on demand entertainment system, (available on all A330, A340-600, 787 and 747 aircraft), and much more.
