Can I make a date change to my ticket?

Most tickets are changeable for a change fee; however this would be subject to the terms and conditions that you have agreed to. If you have not travelled on your ticket yet and have booked through a travel agency, you will need to refer back to them. If you have booked through us directly, you will need to contact our Customer Service Team by phone or live chat as changes cannot be completed online or via email.
