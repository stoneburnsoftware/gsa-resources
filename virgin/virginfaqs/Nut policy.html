What is Virgin Atlantic's nut policy?
Peanuts are never knowingly included in any Virgin Atlantic aircraft meals although our meals are not produced in a nut-free environment so may contain traces. Passengers may request a “Nut Friendly” meal which will not contain peanuts in the ingredients, however, whilst every possible effort will be made, we cannot guarantee that a Nut Friendly meal is completely nut or peanut free due to the environment the meals are produced in.

All other nuts may be served to passengers on all Virgin Atlantic flights as part of the menu ingredients and/or the snack service, in any cabin. We also can’t stop other passengers from bringing (or eating) their own food onboard, which may include peanuts or other types of nuts.

In view of the above, Virgin Atlantic would strongly encourage passengers to take all necessary precautions to prepare for the possibility of inadvertent exposure.

Please note: Our Cabin Crew can make announcements about allergies onboard.
